# ðŸ“® Robert's Chat App 

## Description
This is a real time text chat application, created with an Express/Socket.io backend and a React(CRA) frontend. This is my first project using Material-UI, or any component library for that matter. I normally use styled-components, but for the first time opted to try out Material-Ui using emotion. 

This project was completed as part of a Discord Developer Challenge. Each participant was given the same set of required user stories to complete, upon completing the user stories the challenge is complete. 

In addition to the required user stories, a set of optional user stories with higher difficulty are provided. Each set of user stories can be found in this readme.
