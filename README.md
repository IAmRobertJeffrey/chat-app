# 📮 Robert's Chat App 



## 📝 Description
This is a real time text chat application, created with an Express/Socket.io backend and a React(CRA) frontend. This is my first project using Material-UI, or any component library for that matter. I normally use styled-components, but for the first time opted to try out Material-Ui using emotion. 

This project was completed as part of a [Devjam.](https://discord.com/invite/nZBxGEudY6) Each participant was given the same set of required user stories to complete, upon completing the required user stories the challenge is complete and can be submitted. 

🛠️ Difficulty Level: Advanced <br/>
📅 Start: December 3rd <br/>
📅 Deadline: December 9th 16:00 (4PM) GMT

In addition to the required user stories, a set of optional user stories with higher difficulty are provided. Each set of user stories can be found in this readme.
