## ‚öô Technologies

 This project was created using an Express/Socket.io backend and a React(CRA) frontend. This is my first project using Material-UI, or any component library for that matter. I normally use styled-components, but for the first time opted to try out Material-Ui using emotion. The frontend for this project was hosted on Firebase, the backend was hosted on Heroku.

## üöÄ Contribute

Want to contribute? You can always submit a pull request and I will look at it when I get around to it. Though due to this project being for a devjam, it's unlikely this will be developed much further. You can always talk to me/ask to collaberate on future projects too!
